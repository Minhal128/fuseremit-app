# FuseRemit - DevOps Discovery & Infrastructure Questionnaire

## Document Purpose

This document serves as a comprehensive questionnaire for DevOps engineers working on the FuseRemit fintech mobile application. It is designed to:

1. Gather infrastructure requirements from stakeholders
2. Ensure alignment with backend architecture decisions
3. Document deployment strategies and environment configurations
4. Capture security and compliance requirements

> **Reference**: This document should be used in conjunction with [BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md](./BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md) to ensure infrastructure decisions align with the backend microservices approach.
